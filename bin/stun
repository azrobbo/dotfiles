# make it easier to two hop ssh
# Usage:
# stun user@farhost [nearhost]
#   nearhost - first ssh host that localhost can contact directly
#   farhost  - second ssh host that only nearhost can reach

# caveats:
#   - a public key is necessary on the nearhost because no opportunity
#     is given to log in with a password


# defaults
port=2022
nearhost=u

# if second argument isn't a switch, it must be our nearhost
case ${2} in

    test -z ${2} || nearhost=${2}

esac

# first half of user@host => user
user=${1%@*}
# second half of user@host => host
farhost=${1##*@}


# establish tunnel
ssh -L ${port}:${farhost}:22 -N ${nearhost} &
ssh_pid=$!

# wait for tunnel to start listening
while ! lsof -P -p ${ssh_pid} | grep -q ${port} ; do sleep 1; done

# start interactive session over tunnel
ssh -p ${port} ${user}@localhost

# tear down tunnel after interactive session ends
kill ${ssh_pid}
